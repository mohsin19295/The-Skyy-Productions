#### <p>I have built this project by using tech stacks like `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS`. To make the webpage attractive, animation and box shadow has been used. A `chatting feature` has been added, where users can chat on WhatsApp by clicking on the Whatsapp icon.</p>

#### <p>In the listen now section, data has been fetched from the API. It follows the order from the most views counts video to low views count. User can see three videos by default. If the user clicks on to `See More` button, it will show three more videos and so on. If the user reaches the last video, the `See More` button will be hidden.</P>
